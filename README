A lot of this code comes from folks who are a lot smarter than I am!

The original SPI code comes from the talented Anatolij Gustschin:

Then, additional patches to add GPIO support were written by Ben Maddocks:
https://github.com/bm16ton/ft2232-mpsse-i2c-spi-kern-drivers

My code is based upon Ben Maddocks', with stuff we didn't need (like polled interrupts)
removed for maintainability's sake and better support for our FT2232 chip (like accessing
both MPSSEs!)
